 #:coach-story "My family moved to Saudi Arabia when I was three years old.
                I grew up there, and by the time I was in kindergarten, my family had gotten our first computer.
                Every day when I would come home from school, my mom would teach me how to program that computer.
                The thing is, she didn't actually know how to code, so she taught me out of a book that she had gotten from the library.
                That experience taught me two things from an early age: 1) How to code, and 2) How someone learns to code.
                I got to watch my mom learn something new right in front of me.  She would read the book, think about it, write code to see if it worked,
                talk it over with me, etc.  And when she understood things, she would make sure that I understood it too.
                I'm very grateful to her (my first coding coach), and I've spent the last decade or so trying to pay it forward.
                I've coached many young students personally.  I've coached adult software engineers.  I've coached other coding coaches.  I've
                even coached people on how to coach other coding coaches!  (How meta!)  In short: I'm passionate about helping
                people learn to code, and I'm passionate about helping people learn how to learn.")
